# Jeevan Rakth

Lifeline Innovators' full-stack initiative that connects urgent blood requirements with available donors in real time. The app streamlines discovery, verification, and communication so hospitals and community responders can coordinate faster during critical scenarios.

- `public/` static assets used across the UI, including the app screenshot.
- `src/app/` Next.js App Router entry point with global styles, layout shell, and root page.
- `src/components/` shared UI primitives and composite widgets (currently staged for upcoming sprint work).
- `src/lib/` utilities for API access, data adapters, and configuration helpers.
- Config files at the project root ensure linting, TypeScript, and Next.js runtime settings stay consistent for everyone on the team.

## Setup Instructions

1. Install dependencies: `cd jeevan-rakth && npm install`
2. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
3. Open the app at `http://localhost:3000`
4. Run the linter before committing: `npm run lint`

## Environment Variables

- Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in real credentials; keep `.env.local` untracked so secrets stay off Git.
- `DATABASE_URL` is server-only; reference it with `process.env.DATABASE_URL` inside server components, route handlers, or backend utilities.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` is safe for the browser; import it in client components with `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` for fetch calls.
- Only variables prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` reach client bundles. Avoid using server secrets inside client components or hooks.
- After editing env files, restart `npm run dev` so Next.js picks up the new values.

## Containerization

### Dockerfile

- Located at `jeevan-rakth/Dockerfile` using the `node:20-alpine` base image to keep the runtime lightweight.
- Installs dependencies via `npm install`, copies the full project, and runs `npm run build` to produce the optimized Next.js bundle prior to container startup.
- Exposes port `3000` and launches the production server with `npm run start`.

### Docker Compose

- The root-level `docker-compose.yml` orchestrates the web app, PostgreSQL, and Redis:
	- `app`: Builds from the Next.js Dockerfile, publishes port `3000`, and injects shared env variables (`DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL`).
	- `db`: Uses `postgres:15-alpine`, persists data to the named volume `db_data`, and mirrors port `5432` for local access.
	- `redis`: Uses `redis:7-alpine` and maps port `6379` to the host.
- All services join the `localnet` bridge network so they can resolve each other by service name.
- `db_data` volume ensures Postgres retains its data across container restarts.

### Running the Stack

From the repository root:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Verify everything is healthy:

```bash
# list running containers
docker ps

# optional connectivity checks from the host
psql postgres://postgres:password@localhost:5432/mydb
redis-cli -u redis://localhost:6379 ping
```

Example `docker ps` output when all services are up:

```text
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                  COMMAND                  STATUS          PORTS
abc123def456   s86-1225_app           "docker-entrypoint..."   Up 2 minutes    0.0.0.0:3000->3000/tcp
def456ghi789   postgres:15-alpine     "docker-entrypoint..."   Up 2 minutes    0.0.0.0:5432->5432/tcp
ghi789jkl012   redis:7-alpine         "docker-entrypoint..."   Up 2 minutes    0.0.0.0:6379->6379/tcp
```

If you encounter port-binding conflicts, either stop the conflicting service or adjust the host side of the port mappings (e.g., change `3000:3000` to `3100:3000`). Slow builds typically improve after the initial image pull because subsequent runs reuse cached layers.

## Reflection

We adopted the Next.js App Router layout to keep routing, layouts, and data-fetching logic co-located. Shared UI and utility logic live in `components` and `lib`, letting parallel squads extend the design system or connect to additional services without touching core pages. Centralized configuration files keep build tooling aligned, which de-risks onboarding. As future sprints introduce donor dashboards, hospital triage views, and integrations with Azure/AWS services, this separation lets each slice scale independently while preserving consistent UX and deployment workflows.

## Branching Strategy

- `main` is production-ready and branch protected (PR reviews required, status checks must pass, no direct pushes).
- Feature development: `feature/<feature-name>` such as `feature/donor-matching`.
- Bug fixes: `fix/<bug-name>` such as `fix/navbar-alignment`.
- Tooling or dependency chores: `chore/<task-name>` such as `chore/update-eslint`.
- Documentation updates: `docs/<update-name>` such as `docs/update-readme`.
- Always branch from the latest `main`, keep branches focused on a single concern, and rebase or merge `main` before opening a PR to resolve drift early.

## Pull Request Template

We document every change using [.github/pull_request_template.md](.github/pull_request_template.md). Copy its structure into each PR description:

## Workflow Reflection

This workflow keeps velocity high without sacrificing quality. Consistent branch naming signals intent at a glance and lets automations (boards, CI, deployments) target patterns reliably. The shared PR template standardises author context so reviewers spend less time deciphering change scope. The checklist anchors quality gates around linting, testing, and security, keeping `main` deployable. Branch protection rules enforce review discipline and force teams to reconcile latest changes before merge, preventing regressions and encouraging continuous collaboration.


## **Tooling Setup & Changes**

- **Summary**: Added strict TypeScript, ESLint + Prettier, and Husky + lint-staged pre-commit hooks to enforce formatting and linting before commits.
- **Why**: Catch type and style issues early, keep a consistent code style, and prevent broken commits.

- **Files changed or added**:
	- `jeevan-rakth/tsconfig.json` — enabled strict TypeScript options (`strict`, `noImplicitAny`, `noUnusedLocals`, `noUnusedParameters`, `forceConsistentCasingInFileNames`, `skipLibCheck`).
	- `jeevan-rakth/package.json` — added `prepare` script for Husky and `lint-staged` config; devDependencies updated.
	- `jeevan-rakth/package-lock.json` — updated by npm installs.
	- `jeevan-rakth/.eslintrc.json` — new ESLint configuration (extends Next.js + Prettier rules).
	- `jeevan-rakth/.prettierrc` — new Prettier configuration.
	- `jeevan-rakth/.husky/` — Husky hooks directory with `pre-commit` hook calling `npx lint-staged`.
	- `jeevan-rakth/src/app/globals.css`, `jeevan-rakth/src/app/layout.tsx`, `jeevan-rakth/src/app/page.tsx` — formatted by Prettier.

## **Reproduce / Install Steps**

Run these commands from the `jeevan-rakth` folder (Windows `cmd.exe`):

```
cd F:\jeevanrakth\S86-1225-Lifeline-Innovators-Full-Stack-With-NextjsAnd-AWS-Azure-Jeevan-Rakth\jeevan-rakth
npm install --save-dev prettier eslint-plugin-prettier eslint-config-prettier husky lint-staged
npx husky install
npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "npx lint-staged"
```

Add or update these files with the following contents (examples shown earlier in this repository):

- `tsconfig.json`: ensure strict compiler options are enabled (see project `tsconfig.json`).
- `.eslintrc.json`: extends `next/core-web-vitals` and `plugin:prettier/recommended` with custom rules.
- `.prettierrc`: formatting rules (`singleQuote: false`, `semi: true`, `tabWidth: 2`, `trailingComma: "es5"`).
- `package.json`: include `"prepare": "husky install"` and a `lint-staged` block:

```
"lint-staged": {
	"*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}": ["eslint --fix", "prettier --write"]
}
```

## **Verification / Common Commands**

Run these to verify everything is healthy:

```
npx prettier --check src/
npm run lint
npx tsc --noEmit
npm run build
git status
```

If everything is green, commit the changes (Husky will run the pre-commit hook automatically):

```
git add .
git commit -m "chore: add ESLint/Prettier/Husky and enable strict TypeScript"
```

If lint-staged fixes issues automatically, they will be re-added to the commit. If non-fixable errors exist, fix and re-run the commit.
