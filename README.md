# 🩸  Project name : Jeevan Rakth — Real-Time Blood Donation & Inventory Network  
### *A unified digital lifeline connecting donors, patients, hospitals & NGOs.*

---

## 📘 Project Description
Jeevan Rakth is a full-stack, real-time blood donation and inventory management platform designed to fix India’s biggest challenge in emergency healthcare: fragmented communication and outdated blood availability tracking.  
The platform connects donors, hospitals, NGOs, and emergency responders into one transparent, automated, data-driven ecosystem — ensuring that no life is lost due to delays.

---

## 📌 Overview
Every year, thousands of medical emergencies worsen simply because blood availability is not visible in real-time. Hospitals struggle to connect with verified donors, patients run from one blood bank to another, and NGOs rely on manual calls or WhatsApp chains.

Jeevan Rakth solves this by building a hyper-connected, geolocation-based, automated coordination network for everything related to blood donation, availability, and emergency response.
